# WINDOWS PROCESS KILLER
Program created for killing processes that are being annoying. Sometimes it's impossible to close a process using Task Manager, due to well ... Task Manager being bad. This program comes to the rescue!

- Target process either by name or PID.
- You can run it either as EXE or raw PY file (do note, if you run raw PY file, it won't close some processes due to lack of admin rights).
- So far tested only on Windows 10 (ENG), it should work with both Home & Pro versions. Feedback would be appreciated in terms of compatibility.
- Linux support not planned at the minute, mainly due to me simply not using one. But maybe one day. Also do note it has Windows in the name.
- Raports are generated in the fixed location. It may go crazy if you don't have a C drive in your system. Dynamic path for raports may come in the future.
